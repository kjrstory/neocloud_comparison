# NeoCloud Comparison

This project provides an up-to-date, community-editable comparison of **GPU cloud offerings** from emerging and specialized cloud providers — often referred to as **Neo Cloud Providers** — such as CoreWeave, Lambda Labs, Together AI, and more.

While hyperscalers like AWS, Azure, and GCP dominate in general-purpose services, new players are offering **competitive and specialized GPU infrastructure** with better price-performance, flexibility, and availability. This project aims to compare such services **side-by-side with AWS** and other well-known providers from a compute and GPU availability perspective.

> ✨ The goal is to make it easy for researchers, ML engineers, and cloud architects to understand how modern GPU infrastructure stacks up — across H100, L40S, A100, and even future B100/GB200 instances.

## 🛠 Contributing

This repository is open source — but curated. You’re welcome to contribute data and features related to NeoCloud services that meet the following standard:

**Only providers ranked Gold or higher in the [ClusterMAX](https://semianalysis.com/2025/03/26/the-gpu-cloud-clustermax-rating-system-how-to-rent-gpus/) system are accepted.**

### Valid contributions include:

* Adding new qualified NeoCloud providers
  (e.g., those with Gold+ ClusterMAX ranking)

* Adding new GPU models
  (e.g., L4, B100, RTX 6000 Ada)

* Enhancing comparison data, formatting, or UI

* Submitting PRs to ensure accuracy and consistency
