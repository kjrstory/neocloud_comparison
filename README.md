# NeoCloud Comparison

This project provides an up-to-date, community-editable comparison of **GPU cloud offerings** from emerging and specialized cloud providers — often referred to as **Neo Cloud Providers** — such as CoreWeave, Lambda Labs, Together AI, and more.

While hyperscalers like AWS, Azure, and GCP dominate in general-purpose services, new players are offering **competitive and specialized GPU infrastructure** with better price-performance, flexibility, and availability. This project aims to compare such services **side-by-side with AWS** and other well-known providers from a compute and GPU availability perspective.

> ✨ The goal is to make it easy for researchers, ML engineers, and cloud architects to understand how modern GPU infrastructure stacks up — across H100, L40S, A100, and even future B100/GB200 instances.

## 🛠 Contributing

This repository is fully open source. You’re welcome to contribute GPU pricing data, region availability, or other features related to NeoCloud offerings.

Feel free to:
- Add new providers (e.g., Paperspace, Vultr, Scaleway)
- Add new GPUs (e.g., L4, B100, RTX 6000 Ada)
- Improve formatting, styling, or navigation
- Submit PRs to improve data consistency

Please follow standard pull request etiquette and use YAML linting before submitting.
